## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aidan Nagao, @bobersnip

I've always had a knack for solving problems. If there's a problem, I want to fix it, no matter how small. There is a personal drive that leads me to tackling each and every problem I can find, almost as if to prove to the world that no problem is too large for me.

Of course, problems come up in many different areas. I can't tackle them all, but the one that I have always found interest in is making solutions simpler and more efficient. Now, I'm not sure if my background in Computer Science has lead me here, or if it is the other way around, but I do know that now that I am working in this field, it is truly a blessing to be oriented this way. I truly love writing code; and, the only thing that is more satisfying than having it run successfully is making it more and more efficient.

I have created various projects in my computer science career, but there are a select that were particularly satisfying to create. One of the projects that I poured many hours of work into is a custom command and control malware framework. This project includes a malware implant, server, and client, written in C++, and Python. A particularly special feature of this c2 framework is that it utilizes steganographic images to send and receive commands. 

Another of the few is a photo-sharing website that I built entirely from scratch, using HTML, Python, and MySQL. I created this project alongside a good friend of mine, and we were able to get it running at full intentional functionality within just two weeks. 

The final project is an artificial intelligence that was able to tell, with reasonable accuracy, whether a patient had Covid-19 or pneumonia, based solely on x-ray photos. This project was done in Python with the help of Tensor Flow.

Today, I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon.com Inc.. I have been so blessed to have the opportunity to work at one of the largest modern tech companies in the world.

Specialties: Python, C++, HTML, Java, SQL

Software: Git, Excel, Slack, Teams, Visual Studio Code
